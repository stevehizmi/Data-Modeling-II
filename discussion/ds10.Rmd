## Just for fun (1 min)

<center><a href="https://xkcd.com/539/"><img id="comic" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/boyfriend.png" title="... okay, but because you said that, we're breaking up." style="width:555px;"></a></center>

<br/>



## Discuss together (10-15 min)

As an entire section, discuss these together:

1. How do you interpret an interaction term? (For example, if TV and radio advertising spending were found to have a significant interaction term with estimate 0.0011 when predicting sales, what does the 0.0011 physically mean?) Can you give 2 different interpretations?

2. Remember adding _**any**_ term to your `lm( )` formula will _**always**_ decrease the RSS, even if it's useless (like Karl said, you can test this by adding a randomly-generated column to any regression). How then do you test if adding an effect is significant?

3. How do you include a higher order term in a regression, and what does it represent? (For example, if TV advertising was found to have a significant quadratic term with estimate -0.002, what does it physically mean?)

4. What is the [hierarchy principle](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/ht/03-linear_regression.pdf#page=56), what does it mean, and why should we follow it?

<br/>



## Brief reading (optional, ~ 5 min)

Remember interaction can exist between any combination (2 or more) of categorical and quantitative variables. If you feel like you have a good understanding of how to interpret each of these cases, feel free to move on the next section; if you don't, briefly reading [this page](https://biologyforfun.wordpress.com/2014/04/08/interpreting-interaction-coefficient-in-r-part1-lm/) is highly recommended (pay close attention to the difference in wording for each interpretation and how that difference is reflected in the plots).

<br/>



## Exercise

For the exercise, I have _**modified mtcars**_ by reducing it to the first four columns (`mpg` is still the dependent variable; your predictor variables are now `cyl` `disp` and `hp`), and adding in some combination of significant interactions and/or quadratic terms.

Run the code below to import the new modified data frame, then fit a complete model with **ALL interaction and quadratic** terms (it is not uncommon to add all interaction terms, but you usually wouldn't add all quadratic terms like this unless you had a good reason; we're just doing it here for the sake of the exercise).

```{r}

# first use base R read.csv, then convert to tibblex
# row.names=1 means treat first column as row names       
# text='....' means use this string of text as the data

mtcars2 = as_tibble(read.csv(
  row.names = 1,                  
  text = ",mpg,cyl,disp,hp

After importing the new mtcars data, repeat **all interpretation and prediction steps** of [discussion 9](https://karlrohe.github.io/340-Spring21/discussions/09/ds09.html). Specifically, answer the following questions:

```{r}
 lm.mtcars2 = lm(data = mtcars2, mpg ~ .)
 summary(lm.mtcars2)$coefficients
```

1. What are the coefficient estimates and standard errors? Give an interpretation of **one of the new terms** added in this discussion.

   > _**The coefficient estimates and standard errors are shown above from the code output. Interpreting the Estimate for cyl we see that increasing a cylinder decreases mpg by -2.99.**_

2. What are the R² and adjusted R² for this model? Give an interpretation of both.
```{r}
summary(lm.mtcars2)$r.squared
summary(lm.mtcars2)$adj.r.squared
```

   > _**R squared measures how close the data is to the fitted regression line. R squared adjusted acts the same way except it adjusts the statistic based on the number of independent variables in the model. The higher the number, the better explained the variability around the mean is.**_

3. Give $95\%$ confidence intervals for all coefficients. Give an interpretation of **one of the new intervals**.
```{r}
confint(lm.mtcars2, level = 0.95)
```

   > _**95% of new data for cyl (X) should fall between the interval of [-5.08, -0.0912]**_

4. According to the model, what mileage would I expect on average with a car that has 6 cylinders, 200 displacement, and 120 horsepower? Be careful in your calculation with the interactions and quadratic terms.
```{r}
sample <- data.frame(cyl=6,disp=200,hp=120)
predict(lm.mtcars2,sample)
```
   > _**About 18.7 mpg**_
